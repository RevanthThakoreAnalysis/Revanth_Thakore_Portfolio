                    I've known Revanth for 15 months since he joined my MSc Sports Performance Analysis course in September 2022. Right from the start, he demonstrated remarkable diligence and a strong drive to excel. In class, he eagerly volunteered for assignments that would enrich his future portfolio. Academically, he performed exceptionally well, achieving a high 70%, a testament to his hard work. Revanth's commitment was evident in his attendance at support sessions and his regular communication with tutors for fine-tuning his work. I had the privilege of supervising Revanth's dissertation, where he tackled a complex topic, "Analysing Off-Ball Movement Patterns in Football," and delivered an outstanding project, earning him an excellent 82%. His adept time management, balancing this demanding project with his placement, was commendable. Revanth's year-long placement with Cheltenham Town FC received highly laudatory feedback for his strong work ethic, quality output, and insightful processes. Revanth approaches his work with meticulousness, consistently meeting deadlines. He has not only developed extensive knowledge of software for training and match analysis but also excels in data visualisation tools like Tableau. His passion, pride, and exceptional communication skills make him an asset in various environments and on diverse topics.

                    Opposition reports produced for U18s were really good. The structural breakdown of the game into In possession, Out of Possession, Transitions, and Set-Pieces made the analysis concise and clear. Providing objective evidence with data and visuals added more detail to the attached videos. Well done!

                    We loved Revanth’s analysis for ICC world cup qualifiers. It was well received and distributed to Denmark and Italy cricket teams. Keith Dabengwa, Head Coach at Denmark Cricket saying “Absolutely amazing work”.

                    Revanth delivered a clear and comprehensive presentation on recruitment for the Sunrisers Hyderabad. His ability to outline the need for death hitters was well-executed. Revanth's introduction of the weighting metric was a highlight of the presentation. His explanation, especially the example involving Andre Russell, effectively conveyed how the metric worked. Russell's lower performance in the dot ball metric, offset by the weighting, was an insightful illustration. The presentation was a model of clarity, and Revanth's adept use of Tableau was evident throughout.

                    Match-Up McGrath V Atherton and Axar Patel's player profile analysis projects were excellent. The player profile captured all the metrics and KPIs well, especially the matrix where you compared him with other bowlers. Exactly how you should analyse real-world situations. The structure and storytelling of the Match-Up analysis were also great. Good stuff!

                    The England Futsal Performance Programme has benefited tremendously from the research and data Revanth Thakore collected to analyse standard playing methodologies and tactical systems deployed by the World’s best Futsal nations during the FIFA Futsal World Cup 2021. The statistical analysis on goals scored from set pieces and within the ‘Powerplay’ utilising a Fly GK was exceptional. We look forward to calling on Revanth’s future services to inform our coaching program better and where to concentrate our efforts to improve on the International stage.
